# horiseon-code-refactor

## Description

This Website is for a Marketing Agency who wanted a codebase that follows accessibility standards and that the site is optimized for search engines. 

As a developer I learnt about Semantic HTML Elements and the importance of structure, I learnt how to reduce a CSS style code by condensing classes into one.
